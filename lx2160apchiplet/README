LS2160A-PCHIPLET supports 3 serdes, devided into 6 slots.

The RCW directories names for the LS2160A-PCHIPLET boards conform to the following
naming convention:

abcd_efgh_ijkl_mnop_qrst_uvwx_RR_A_B_C:

f = What is available on serdes 1 slot 2, LANE 5
g = What is available on serdes 1 slot 2, LANE 6
h = What is available on serdes 1 slot 2, LANE 7

For Serdes2:
i = What is available on serdes 2 slot 3, LANE 0
j = What is available on serdes 2 slot 3, LANE 1
k = What is available on serdes 2 slot 3, LANE 2
l = What is available on serdes 2 slot 3, LANE 3
m = What is available on serdes 2 slot 4, LANE 4
n = What is available on serdes 2 slot 4, LANE 5
o = What is available on serdes 2 slot 4, LANE 6
p = What is available on serdes 2 slot 4, LANE 7

For Serdes3:
q = What is available on serdes 3 slot 5, LANE 0
r = What is available on serdes 3 slot 5, LANE 1
s = What is available on serdes 3 slot 5, LANE 2
t = What is available on serdes 3 slot 5, LANE 3
u = What is available on serdes 3 slot 6, LANE 4
v = What is available on serdes 3 slot 6, LANE 5
w = What is available on serdes 3 slot 6, LANE 6
x = What is available on serdes 3 slot 6, LANE 7

For the Serdes(6 Slots) Lanes (a..x):
 'N' is NULL, not available/not used
 'H' is SATA
 'S' is SGMII
 'P' is PCIe
 'F' is XFI/USXGMII
 'G' is 25G
 'L' is 50G
 'X' is 40G
 'C' is 100G

RGMII Interface (R):
  'R' is RGMII Interface 1G

Serdes1 protocol (A):
A = 'serdes1 protocol value (decimal)'

Serdes2 protocol (B):
B = 'serdes2 protocol value (decimal)'

Serdes3 protocol (C):
C = 'serdes3 protocol value (decimal)'

Ref clock setting on board
==========================
DDR Ref clock: 100 MHz
Sys PLL Ref clock: 100MHz

Files naming convention
=============================
rcw_x_l_m_n.rcw
rcw_x_l_m_n_bootmode.rcw
rcw_x_y_l_m_n.rcw
rcw_x_y_z_l_m_n.rcw

x = Core frequency
y = Platform frequency
z = DDR frequency
bootmode = FlexSPI/sd
l = 'serdes1 protocol value'
m = 'serdes2 protocol value'
n = 'serdes3 protocol value'

For example,
  rcw_2000_19_5_2.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 2000MHz, with serdes1=19 serdes2=5 serdes3=2.
  rcw_2000_700_19_5_2.rcw means rcw for core frequency 2000MHz and Platform frequecny 700MHz, with serdes1=19 serdes2=5 serdes3=2.
  rcw_2000_700_2400_19_5_2.rcw means rcw for core frequency 2000MHz, Platform frequecny 700MHz and DDR Memory Data Rate as 2400 MT/s, with serdes1=19 serdes2=5 serdes3=2.
  rcw_2000_19_5_2_sd.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 2000MHz with SD boot, with serdes1=19 serdes2=5 serdes3=2.



Reference card connections on different serdes slots (as per serdes protocol)
=============================================================================

Serdes Protocol 3_3_2:
  Slot1: M11(USXGMII)/M12(XFI)
  Slot2: M4
  Slot3: M4
  Slot4: M4
  Slot5 & Slot6: M1

Errata Workaround Implemented
=============================
A-009531:
  The PCI Express controller as the completer sends completion packets with IDO
  bit set in packet header even when the IDO Completion Enable bit is cleared in
  the controllerâ€™s Device Control 2 Register.
  Applicable for SNP PCIe controller

A-008851:
  Invalid transmitter/receiver preset values are used in Gen3 equalization
  phases during link training for RC mode
  This errata is valid only for PCI gen3.
  Workaround:
   write 0x00000001 to MISC_CONTROL_1_OFF
   write 0x4747 to Lane Equalization Control register for each lane
  Applicable for SNP PCIe controller
